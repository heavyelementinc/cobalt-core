# 1. Preamble

In the interest of combatting misinformation and (paramount to all else) to build trust with our audience and customers, Heavy Element has publish and committed to this Code of Ethics.

Heavy Element, the Gardiner Bryant channels, ViewSink, our other Brands and our Employees (collectively "Brands," "Employees," "we," "us," "our") shall adhere to this Code of Ethics.

# 2. Integrity

Heavy Element is committed to truth. Our job as an organization is to foster trust and remain fidelitous to honesty and factuality.

## 2.a - Journalism

We often report on the news. We pledge to do our best to research and report factual information. We take this job seriously. 

Heavy Element believes that impartiality is an *pretentious affect* and it is actually harmful to journalism as a whole. In fact, we believe the inclusion of our informed opinions *enhances the value of our reporting*. 

Therefore, our Employees are encouraged to include their point of view and commentary alongside their reports. *We trust you're smart enough to know the difference*.

### Benchmarking

Benchmarking of products will be conducted in good faith and with t

### Errors

From time to time, we may make a mistake. Where possible, we shall amend the content with an "Edit" or "Update" section. 

If it's not possible to effectively modify the work directly, we will include an "Edit" or "Update" section in the metadata. Depending on the severity of the error, it may be necessary to issue a retraction or de-list content. Retractions shall be issued in the same medium as the error was made.

In the event of high-severity errors and de-listing is considered necessary, de-listings shall be accompanied by a post in our News section along with an explanation for the content's removal.

## 2.b - Product Reviews

Content falls under the definition of a "Product Review" if:


1. the vendor gives us a product to review regardless of if we get to keep the product after the content is created, AND
2. the vendor has not compensated us to produce the content, AND
3. gets no editorial input, OR
4. we have bought a product with our own money

Crucially, vendors get no creative or editorial input in a "Product Review." Unless the content is marked as a "Product Integration" or as "Sponsored Content," review-style content are reviews.

We believe that trust is paramount in our reviews. Therefore we pledge that:

* We will make a good faith effort to thoroughly review any products we buy or that are given to us
* We will not allow the fact that a product was gifted to us to influence our review
* We **DO NOT give vendors previews** of our reviews before they go live
* Vendors get **NO EDITORIAL INPUT** as we produce a reviews for their product, however:
  * We may use marketing copy, press releases, spec sheets, etc. created by the vendor
  * If needed, we may contact the vendor for guidance on usage, clarification, or troubleshooting assistance. This will be disclosed in the review.

## 2.c - Integrations

We may, at our discretion, accept sponsorships, endorsements, etc. for products and services (collectively "Integrations"). When we do, we shall disclaim the sponsorship in a clear and obvious way. This shall be done in accordance with FTC guidelines.

* Integrations must be clearly marked as a "Paid Integration" or other such language
* Integrations must be distinct from the body of the content being sponsored
* If the entirety of the content is sponsored, the content must be clearly marked as "Sponsored Content" with a link to this document

Heavy Element shall make a good faith effort to vet our Integration Partners and that their practices align with this Code of Ethics.

### Sponsored Content

Paid Integrations may also include our creation of "Sponsored Content." To meet our definition of "Sponsored Content," it must meet the following criteria:


1. a vendor gives us their product regardless of what happens to the product after the content is created, AND
2. the vendor compensates us for the creation of the content, AND
3. the vendor has editorial control over the content

In the case of a Product Integration, vendors will receive a preview copy of the content before it goes live and has editorial input on the content.

> While we generally **avoid** such content, we wanted to offer our definition so you can be confident in our content

# 3. Artificial Intelligence

From time to time, we may use so-called "Generative AI" tools including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc. Whenever AI output is included in our productions, every instance of use shall be *clearly marked*, except for in the following circumstances:

* The AI output does not substantively differ from the input, non-exhaustive examples:
  * Human-written input is reworded without changing the meaning, OR
  * AI is used to reformat a human-written document
* The AI output is not used in the body of the work, for example
  * The metadata of a post

Brands and Employees are strictly prohibited from knowingly posting, sharing, or distributing (nor causing the posting, sharing or distribution) of AI-generated work, in whole or in part, without the clear and obvious declaration that such content was generated by an AI.
