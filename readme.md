Cobalt Engine is meant to provide developers with a simple and intuitive router-based web development frontend. It's compatible with Docker and easily deployed.

Cobalt aims to provide an all-in-one framework which includes
 * An expressive HTML template engine
 * A hybrid backend/frontend routing system
 * Route contexts for HTML content, RESTful APIs, webhooks, and more
 * Frontend WebComponents for easily interacting with the API
 * User account management and extendable permission system

It was created by [Heavy Element, Inc](https://heavyelement.io).

> **NOTE** *Cobalt Engine is still in an ALPHA STATE. That means it is currently **not considered stable**. We are constantly adding new features, removing broken ones, and tweaking thing. If you use Cobalt in a production environment **you do so at your own risk**.*
